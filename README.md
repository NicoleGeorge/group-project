# Game of Thrones: THE FANDOM ZONE APP
"inside the Fandom Zone is where the magic happens"

# Client Brief
Our Client, Oz Comic Con, wants to generate interest around Kit Harington as their special guest at the 2021 convention. They are running a competition to meet the star of the television series, Kit Harington, via a cosplay contest. They want an app that will appeal to their newer fans as a way to research their favourite character and register for the competition.

# Elevator Pitch
Generation Z (Gen-Z) is going to represent 82 million people by 2026, and they grew up swiping before they could talk. They are expected to be the next wave of Game of Thrones fans.

Their core values are rooted in authenticity and freedom of expression. 
With these factors in mind, we created the immersive portal, The Fandom Zone.

Once Gen-Z is enthralled in the bloody saga between the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros, fans will be looking for a place to satisfy their insatiable appetite for all things Game of Thrones related.

Our focus was coming up with a way for fans to purge their new found interest, while meeting the goal of our client, Oz Comic Con - to create buzz around Kit Harington, aka Jon Snow, being their special guest at the 2021 convention.
